Project title  
- Rock Paper Scissors 
Game in Python: A simple game where the user competes against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors.

Overview of the project  
- This project is a basic Python implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game. The computer randomly selects an option, and the user inputs their choice. The game then decides the winner based on traditional rules.

Features  
- Random computer choice using Python's random module  
- User input handling with case normalization  
- Clear outcome messages for win, lose, or tie situations

Technologies/tools used  
- Python programming language  
- random module for random choice generation

Steps to install & run the project  
- Ensure Python is installed (version 3.x recommended)  
- Save the script in a .py file  
- Run the script via command line or Python IDE  
- Enter your choice when prompted

Instructions for testing  
- Run the script multiple times  
- Enter different valid inputs: rock, paper, scissors  
- Verify the correct determination of winner or tie in various scenarios  
- Handle invalid inputs by extending the code (optional)
